# WhereAmI
WhereAmI is a web application that allows you to see interesting places based on your location and lets you upload new videoclips directly on YouTube!

WhereAmI consists of:

   - a Browser: it is a map showing your current position and places around you. You can listen to audioclips about these         places, filter them with some parameters and get directions
   
   - an Editor: you can add new places by just clicking on the map, filling a form and recording new clips.
   

For a better experience turn on your device location. 
If you want to record a clip you will have to sign in using your Google account and give audio/video permissions for recording.


WhereAmI is a project built using these technologies:
  - Bootstrap v4
  - Leaflet API for the map and Leaflet Routing Machine for the directions
  - OLC 
  - MediaRecorder API
  - Google API
  - YouTube API
